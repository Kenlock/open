SUPPLEMENT_FIXTURES_NAME_AND_NOTES = {
    "Ashwagandha": """A number of studies suggest that it has anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects; studies are mostly supportive of a notable effect of ashwagandha for this purpose, and it seems to reduce cortisol levels. However, more research is needed before we can have a great deal of confidence in it or know the optimal dose. Ashwagandha may also be able to reduce insomnia, fatigue, and the symptoms of depression, but it hasn't been well-researched for these purposes.
It may increase power output in untrained subjects during resistance exercise and anaerobic running, but this observation is based on a small amount of research and more is needed. It may lead to small reductions in blood glucose, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol, while slightly increasing HDL-cholesterol. Additionally, it may modestly increase testosterone and sperm quality in infertile men.""",
    "BCAA": """For people with low dietary protein intake, BCAA supplementation can promote muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle growth over time. Supplementation can also be used to prevent fatigue in novice athletes.""",
    "Creatine": """Creatine is a molecule that's produced in the body from amino acids. It's primarily made in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and pancreas. It stores high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine which are donated to ADP, regenerating it to ATP, the primary energy carrier in the body. This role in energy production is particularly relevant under conditions of high energy demand such as intense physical or mental activity""",
    "Curcumin": """Curcumin, the primary bioactive substance in turmeric, and has anti-inflammatory properties and decent evidence for indications from chronic pain to depression. It has poor bioavailability alone, necessitating special formulations to be efficiently absorbed.""",
    "Fish Oil": """Fish oil is a a source of omega-3 fatty acids. It reduces triglycerides, but does not seem to affect the rate of cardiovascular events. It seems to notably reduce the symptoms of depression and improve some painful, inflammatory conditions.""",
    "Vitamin C": """Vitamin C is an essential vitamin with antioxidant properties. It is frequently supplemented to ward off the common cold, though its efficacy is questionable, and likely low.""",
    "Zinc": """Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous enzymes. It plays a role in antioxidant enzymes, brain function, and the immune system, among many other biological roles. Zinc is most commonly taken to reduce the frequency of illness and to support optimal levels of testosterone.""",
    "Caffeine": """Caffeine comes from coffee beans, but it can also be synthesized in a laboratory. It has the same structure whether itâ€™s in coffee, energy drinks, tea or pills.

Caffeine is a powerful stimulant, and it can be used to improve physical strength and endurance. It is classified as a nootropic because it sensitizes neurons and provides mental stimulation.

Habitual caffeine use is also associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.""",
    "Krill Oil": "Krill oil is a mixture of fatty acids high in EPA and DHA (fish oil fatty acids) in the form of phospholipids, mostly as phosphatidylcholine; it appears to be better absorbed than fish oil, may be more cardioprotective, and has some unique (unexplored) fat burning effects.",
    "Garlic": "Garlic is a pungent herb. It has also been shown to be an effective treatment for high blood pressure, when taken as a concentrated supplement. ",
    "Niacin": "Also known as vitamin B3, niacin is talked up as a cure for all sorts of conditions (including high cholesterol, Alzheimer's, diabetes and headaches) but in most of these cases, a prescription-strength dose of niacin has been needed to show a clear result.",
    "Vitamin D": "A 2008 meta-analysis (a review of a number of studies conducted on the same topic) of 17 randomized controlled trials concluded that it decreased overall mortality in adults. A 2013 meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials came to the same conclusion. In other words, by randomly deciding which participants took the supplement and which didn't and tightly controlling other variables (thereby reducing the effect of confounding factors), the researchers found that adults who took vitamin D supplements daily lived longer than those who didn't.",

    "Krill Oil 2": "Krill oil is a mixture of fatty acids high in EPA and DHA (fish oil fatty acids) in the form of phospholipids, mostly as phosphatidylcholine; it appears to be better absorbed than fish oil, may be more cardioprotective, and has some unique (unexplored) fat burning effects.",
    "Garlic 3": "Garlic is a pungent herb. It has also been shown to be an effective treatment for high blood pressure, when taken as a concentrated supplement. ",
    "Niacin 4": "Also known as vitamin B3, niacin is talked up as a cure for all sorts of conditions (including high cholesterol, Alzheimer's, diabetes and headaches) but in most of these cases, a prescription-strength dose of niacin has been needed to show a clear result.",
    "Vitamin D 5": "A 2008 meta-analysis (a review of a number of studies conducted on the same topic) of 17 randomized controlled trials concluded that it decreased overall mortality in adults.
