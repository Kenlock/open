Hi. This is a fun repo that I use to contain all my open source ideas. It serves as my justification to try out new 
ideas, but with having a bit of an overengineered infrastructure so that my OCD is content.

If you're familiar with Django, this will probably be very similar to repos you've previously seen. 

Unfortunately due to time constraints, I can't offer support.  

In the future, I'm expecting to move a lot of machine learning projects about health into this repo.
